      This website was built as part of the Rails course of 
      <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>.  Members 
      of the website can create public posts, any only other members can learn 
      the identity of the posts' author.  It's like a secret clubhouse where 
      one can post anonymous messages to the general public.
